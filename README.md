- Implemented mesh manipulation using MeshFilter data and Mesh optimization.
- Allows deformation and modification of meshes in real-time, resulting in a visually appealing game world.
- Provides flexibility and can be used to create a variety of visual effects.
- Implemented texture atlas to optimize texture mapping.
- Allows combining multiple textures into a single image, reducing draw calls and improving game performance.
- Useful for games that require a large number of textures, such as open-world games.
- Created a voxel world by combining different blocks.
- Allows creating complex 3D environments using simple geometric shapes.
- Useful for games that require environmental interaction, such as building or crafting games.
- Design techniques provide flexibility and optimization, allowing for visually stunning game worlds and high interactivity while maintaining good performance.
- Effective utilization of these techniques results in engaging and immersive game experiences for players.
