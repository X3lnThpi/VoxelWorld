# VoxelWorld
I have implemented mesh manipulation using MeshFilter data and Mesh optimization, allowing me to deform and modify meshes in real-time, resulting in a more dynamic and visually appealing game world. This technique provides a lot of flexibility and can be used to create a variety of visual effects.

I have also implemented texture atlas to optimize texture mapping, allowing multiple textures to be combined into a single image, reducing the number of draw calls, and improving game performance. This technique can be particularly useful in games that require a large number of textures, such as open-world games.

Additionally, I have created a voxel world by combining different blocks, allowing you to create complex 3D environments using simple geometric shapes. This approach is particularly useful for games that require a lot of environmental interaction, such as building or crafting games.

Overall, these design techniques provide a lot of flexibility and optimization, allowing me to create visually stunning game worlds with a high level of interactivity while maintaining good performance. By utilizing these techniques effectively, I can create engaging and immersive game experiences for your players.
